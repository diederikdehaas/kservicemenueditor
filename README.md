kservicemenueditor
==================

KDE Service Menu Editor

This is the kservicemenueditor as created by David Edmundson which allows you 
to create/modify/delete your service menu entries. 
The code was obtained from http://www.sharpley.org.uk/node/3 and with David's 
permission I'm sharing this code on github under the GPLv2 license.

For now this is just the original code where only the license information has 
been updated. I am going to use it to learn how to create a GUI application 
for use in KDE/QT in Python, but since I'm quite new to this, it may take a 
while before any changes/improvements are made.
